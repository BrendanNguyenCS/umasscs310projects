1. I found that these programs were quite straightforward. I haven't polished up on my Java recently due to the amount
of time since my last Java course and also my full time summer internship that codes in a different language. I needed
familiarize myself with the different objects and their methods that were using during this assignment. I used the IntelliJ
IDE on my local Windows laptop. The majority of the issues I faced during this assignment was related to setting up my IDE 
and command line. I recently had to factory reset my laptop to fix battery issues so everything was reset. After installing the
java JDK via Intellij, I didn't realize that I needed to set up the environment variables on my system in order to use the java 
and javac command in the command line. After fixing this, I was able to compile my files locally. I also ran into issues with
setting up the file structure. Prior to the start of the semester, I had created a private Git repo so I could keep all of my code
for this class. However, when I tried to add the files (mirroring the given structure from the assignment), java wouldn't compile
(I could also tell something was off since the built-in intellisense wasn't recognizing the commands in the IDE). I had to create
the java project separately and then attach the git remote branch to this directory. I was able to fix all of my problems and
everything works now.

2. For LineUsage.addObservation, the time complexity is defined by the time complexity of the containsKey method that is called.
This containsKey method just checks every key-value pair meaning that the time complexity is O(n). For LineUsage.findMaxUsage,
the time complexity can be determined by the for-loop. Because the for-loop loops through each entry in the hashmap, the time
complexity of this method is also O(n). LineReport.generateReport also have a for-loop for searching through the LineUsage array,
meaning that the time complexity is O(n). Overall, the time complexity would be O(n).
